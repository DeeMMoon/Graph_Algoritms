## Tasks

Within this task, all graphs must meet the following requirements:
- Edge weights are only natural numbers
- There may be loops
- Weights may differ on all edges
- Only a nonzero connected graph

## Part 1. Depth- and Breadth-first search 

Implementation of the _s21_graph.h_  library:  
* The library must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard
* The library code must be located in the src folder in the develop branch  
* When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style
* Make it as a static library (with the _s21_graph.h_ header file)
* The library must be represented as a `Graph` class that stores information about the graph using an **adjacency matrix**. The dimensionality of the adjacency matrix should be set dynamically when initializing the graph (when loading it from a file)
* The program must be built with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs: _all, clean, test, s21_graph.a_
*Prepare full coverage of the `Graph` class methods with unit-tests
* The class `Graph` must contain at least the following public methods:
    + `LoadGraphFromFile(string filename)` - loading a graph from a file in the adjacency matrix format
    + `ExportGraphToDot(string filename)`- exporting a graph to a dot file (see materials)

Implementation of the _s21_graph_algorithms.h_ library:  
* The library must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard
* The library code must be located in the src folder in the develop branch  
* Make it as a static library (with the _s21_graph_algorithms.h_ header file)
* The library must be represented as a ` GraphAlgorithms ` class that stores the implementation of algorithms on graphs. The class `GraphAlgorithms` itself must not know anything about the internal representation of the graph from the class `Graph`. To interact with graph data, the class `GraphAlgorithms` can only use the public methods and properties provided by the `Graph` class. 
* Add to the Makefile _s21_graph_algorithms.a_ target 
*Prepare full coverage of the `GraphAlgorithms` class methods with unit-tests
* The class ` GraphAlgorithms ` must contain at least the following public methods:
    + `DepthFirstSearch(Graph &graph, int start_vertex)` - a *non-recursive* depth-first search in the graph from a given vertex. The function should return an array that contains the traversed vertices in the order they were traversed. When implementing this function, you must use the *self-written* data structure **stack**, which should be previously made as a separate static library
    + `BreadthFirstSearch(Graph &graph, int start_vertex)` - breadth-first search in the graph from a given vertex. The function should return an array that contains the traversed vertices in the order they were traversed. When implementing this function, you must use the *self-written* data structure **queue**, which should be previously made as a separate static library
* It is necessary to use *self-written* helper classes `Stack` and `Queue` (you can reuse your solution from the *CPP2* project for this). These classes must contain the following methods:
    + `stack()` - creating an empty stack
    + `queue()` - creating an empty queue
    + `push(value)` - adding an element to the stack/queue
    + `pop()` - getting an element from the stack/queue followed by its removal from the stack/queue
    + `top()` - getting an element from the stack without its removal from the stack
    + `front()` - getting the first element from the queue without its removal from the queue
    + `back()` - getting the last element from the queue without its removal from the queue

*In this and the following tasks, consider that the vertex numbers start from 1*

## Part 2. Finding the shortest paths in a graph

* Add two new methods to the `GraphAlgorithms` class:
    + `GetShortestPathBetweenVertices(Graph &graph, int vertex1, int vertex2)` - searching for the shortest path between two vertices in a graph using *Dijkstra's algorithm*. The function accepts as input the numbers of two vertices and returns a numerical result equal to the smallest distance between them
    + `GetShortestPathsBetweenAllVertices(Graph &graph)` - searching for the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph using the *Floyd-Warshall algorithm*. As a result, the function returns the matrix of the shortest paths between all vertices of the graph

## Part 3. Finding the minimum spanning tree

* Add a new method to the `GraphAlgorithms` class:
    + `GetLeastSpanningTree(Graph &graph)` - searching for the minimal spanning tree in a graph using *Prim's algorithm*. As a result, the function should return the adjacency matrix for the minimal spanning tree

## Part 4. Travelling salesman problem

* Add a new method to the `GraphAlgorithms` class:
    + `SolveTravelingSalesmanProblem(Graph &graph)` - solving the traveling salesman's problem using the *ant colony algorithm*.
You need to find the shortest path that goes through all vertices of the graph at least once, followed by a return to the original vertex. As a result, the function should return the `TsmResult` structure described below:
    ```cpp
    struct TsmResult {
        int* vertices;    // an array with the route you are looking for (with the vertex traverse order). Instead of int* you can use std::vector<int>
        double distance;  // the length of this route
    }
    ``` 

*If it is impossible to solve the problem with a given graph, output an error.*

## Part 5. Console interface

* You need to write the main program, which is a console application for testing the functionality of the implemented s21_graph.h and s21_graph_algorithms.h libraries 
* The console interface must provide the following functionality:
    1. loading the original graph from a file
    2. graph traversal in breadth with output of the result to the console   
    3. graph traversal in depth with output of the result to the console
    4. searching for the shortest path between any two vertices and displaying the result to the console
    5. searching for the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in the graph with the output of the resulting matrix to the console
    6. searching for the minimal spanning tree in the graph with the output of the resulting adjacency matrix to the console
    7. solving the salesman problem with the output of the resulting route and its length to the console

## Part 6. Bonus. Comparison of methods for solving the traveling salesman problem

* It is necessary to choose two additional algorithms to solve the traveling salesman problem and implement them as methods of the `GraphAlgorithms` class
* Add to the console interface the ability to perform a comparison of  speed of the three algorithms (the ant colony algorithm and two randomly selected algorithms)
    + The study starts for a graph that was previously loaded from a file.
    + As part of the study you need to keep track of the time it took to solve the salesman's problem `N` times in a row, by each of the algorithms. Where `N` is set from the keyboard.
    + The results of the time measurement must be displayed in the console.

*Example:* For `N = 1000` it will measure how long it will take to solve the traveling salesman problem 1000 times for the current given graph by an ant colony algorithm and two randomly chosen algorithms.


## Chapter IV

`-` "Bob asked if we could take the task, and so we did. I'd love to take you along with it, but Bob has his own ideas," Alice answered Eve's question.

`-` "Still, I don't see how your job has anything to do with a robot vacuum cleaner," Eve complained. "Where's Charlie? He used to drop by at least a couple of times a week."

`-` "Charlie... is working. We've got a little problem, and your pathfinding work is exactly what will help us. Don't worry, when it's all over, our evening gatherings will be back. Then we'll discuss everything," calming, but sadly assured Alice. "Thanks for your time, I have to go. See you later!"
